# bio-algs

Clojure code being used for Bioinformatics Algorithms Coursera class: https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics

Disclaimer, don't look at this for examples of clojure code.  Much of this is has serious issues, due to
* I'm implementing some algorithms that are actually bad (intentionally, their flaws and better algorithms are shown later in the course)
* In many cases there already is a built in function to do what I'm doing, but I don't want to cheat
* The pseudocode for the algorithms is usually presented in a more imperative format, and some of that style probably leaks into my implementation
* Many of my clojure skills are out of date
* Some of these algorithms *may* have been implemented late at night with only hours to go before the deadline

In general each namespace (other than core) corresponds to a lesson from the course.  I did not quite finish the 4th and 5th chapters (I'm going to blame the holidays because they are a convenient excuse), which end up being for namepsaces bio-algs.genome and bio-algs.dynprog
