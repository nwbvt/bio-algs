# bio-algs

Clojure code being used for Bioinformatics Algorithms Coursera class
Disclaimer, don't look at this for examples of clojure code.  Much of this is has serious issues, due to
* I'm implementing some algorithms that are actually bad
* In many cases there already is a built in function to do what I'm doing, but I don't want to cheat
* In many cases I'm basically copying pseudocode that assumes a more imperative language
* Many of my clojure skills are out of date
